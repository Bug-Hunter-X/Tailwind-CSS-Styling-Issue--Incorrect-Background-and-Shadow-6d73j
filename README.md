# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue when working with Tailwind CSS: unexpected styling inconsistencies.  The problem involves a combination of utility classes that seem to conflict, resulting in a visual mismatch between expected and actual rendering.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code snippet, showcasing the incorrectly styled element. The solution in `bugSolution.js` offers a fix, along with explanations of the root cause and the best practice for avoiding such situations in the future.

This example focuses on background color and shadow issues; however, the underlying problem can manifest with various other utility classes and should provide a valuable learning opportunity for developers working with Tailwind CSS.
